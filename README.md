## Assisted Segmentation of Pancreatic Islets and Quantification (ASPIQ)

The ASPIQ ImageJ/Fiji macros have been developed to increase the automation level of the segmentation and quantification of murine pancreatic islets captured in multi-channel fluorescence microscopy images. 
It could be shown that the scripts are further suitable for segmenting and quantifying murine pancreatic lymph nodes after modifying the minimum object size.  

Beside providing a time-reducing approach in comparison with manual analyses, the scripts help to fulfill laboratory documentation standards by logging scripts parameter and saving threshold images as well as ROIs. Therefor they enable the reproducibility of the analyses.

Please read the ASPIQ_Workflow_Userguide for detailed instructions how to use the scripts.
